## **Victorian Age**

The Victorian Age starts in 1838 and takes the name from Queen Victoria. It was a period of great advancement in many fields such as medical, scientific and technological. The British Empire was expanding to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It meant to the Empire a geographical, commercial and political growth.

The Crystal Palace, built to host the Great Exhibition of 1851, was one of the greatest engineering feats of the 19th century. Important technological innovations were:
+ railways and trains;
+ Royal Mail.
The English language also expanded: as new country started to speak English, there was the need of new words because other countries had different flora, fauna and foods. Many new accents were introduced as well.

The novel became the most popular literary genre of the time. People usually read novels in groups. Embarassing topics were often avoided, especially in novels for women and children.
The Bronte sisters[^3] written many stories and novels filled with emotions.
Literature for children became very important. It served to educate them. The stories were gender-specific:
+ girls stories tended to promote the role of women as wives, focused on family life;
+ boys stories were more about adventures encouraging recruits for the navy and the army.

Several publications on magazines and newspapers were how most novelist at the time published their work. We can compare the stories to today's TV series: coming out every week, leaving something to discover in the following episode. Charles Dickens was one of the main writer of that period.

Victorian Era focused on social issues: the Industrial Revolution had led to an increase in the density of the urban population, resulting in an extremely high level of poverty. In 1834, the Poor Law were introduced, which gave food and board to the poor in jail-like conditions in exchange for very unpleasant jobs.
